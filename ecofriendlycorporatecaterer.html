                <p>Hi! We’re Wild Roots Kitchen & Bar and we provide awesome, ethical, planet-saving catering, right here in South Wales.  We’re passionate about supplying great tasting, locally sourced and sustainable food and drink, with an unparalleled level of service and always with a smile!</p>
                <p>At Wild Roots, we’re always reviewing our practices and our methods to ensure we’re constantly being the best we can be and since our inception just before the COVID-19 outbreak, we’ve discovered that in order to succeed as a new business - particularly due to the challenges we’ve all faced over the past few years – you need to pivot and evolve.</p>
                <p>And it turns out that pivoting and evolving is something we’re particularly good at!</p>
                <p>You might be aware that we started life as a wedding catering company, to work hand in hand with our sister business <a href="https://wwww.zoebinning.co.uk">Zoë Binning Limited</a>, (a white-label wedding venue management service) and provide eco-friendly, sustainable and ethical wedding catering with a focus on excellent, primarily plant-based, delicious food.  But that was just at the start of a global pandemic that ground all things weddings to an abrupt halt, and as a result, we started to explore other options…</p>

                <center><img class="blogSmallImage" src="./Images/blogFour/Christmas2020.jpg" alt="Wild Roots Kitchen & Bar How we became an eco friendly corporate caterer in South Wales – Zoom Christmas party boxes 2020"></center>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>…Enter our ‘Zoom Christmas Party Boxes’ designed to provide fabulous party food in a box, delivered to delegates across South Wales to enable them to still enjoy their team Christmas party, despite the national lockdown we were all struggling through!</p>
                <p>This turned out to be a defining moment for Wild Roots as once Christmas was done and dusted and we all continued to have to work from home, and the companies whom we had catered for over Christmas asked us to continue to supply their zoom team meetings and our <a href="#whatWeDo">corporate catering</a>  business took off!</p>
                <p>We delivered working lunches to team members across South Wales, mainly around Cardiff, Caerphilly, Newport and Bridgend, for the months to come and once things started opening back up and those teams returned to their offices, desks and face to face meetings, we continued to serve their corporate lunches either individually packaged or on buffet platters.</p>

            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Still with a focus on <a href="/sustainability">sustainability</a>, still with plant-based locally-sourced food at its core, still with carefully considered plastic-free compostable, recycled and recyclable packaging and still with the same friendly, professional service our clients love.</p>
                <p>And much as we’d love to do everything, it turns out that even we’re not able to spin that many plates (without smashing a few!) and so we had to make a choice and move away from our roots (see what we did there?!) and took the really difficult decision to put our wedding catering business aside and concentrate on our fabulous corporate customers.</p>
                <p>And we’re working hard to continue to grow that side of the business, so if you are an office team looking for something other than the usual business lunch buffet, or you’re still organising department meetings via zoom and missing out on a fabulous lunchtime solution for your delegates – then check out our <a href="#whatWeDo">sample menus</a> and <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> to book our planet-saving catering delivered to your door, right in time for lunch!</p>
