                The catering and the weddings industries are renowned for being very wasteful in nature, but we wanted to do things differently! 
            </br>
            </br>
            Here at Wild Roots, sustainability and social responsibility are central to absolutely everything that we do and before we make any decisions, buy anything or agree to any idea, we try very hard to consider the environmental and social impact of our actions, so that we can work out how to do things better. 
            </br>
            </br>
            We created Wild Roots to enable us to control the supply chain and create environmentally-friendly choices, offering locally-sourced and sustainably-raised meat, fish and vegetables as well as a much wider range of plant-based menu options for our customers, than you’d usually expect to find at a large catered event.  All wrapped in fully compostable and/or recycled and recyclable packaging. 
            </br>
            </br>
            We don’t get it right every time and we know that’s its an ever-evolving challenge, but we are trying every day to reduce our carbon footprint and to become more eco-aware in our approach to everything we tackle as a business.

        <p>Although becoming carbon neutral solely through tree planting is not the endgame, it does at least help to mitigate some of our impact, whilst we tackle those areas currently out of our control.</p>
